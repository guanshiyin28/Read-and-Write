# Read and Write

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive starting point for understanding and implementing basic file operations: reading from and writing to files. These operations are implemented in Python and serve as a great introduction to file handling for beginners and intermediate programmers.

<hr><br>

## Purpose of This Repository

### Reading from Files

Reading from files is a fundamental operation that allows programs to access and utilize data stored in text files. This repository provides examples of how to open a file, read its contents, and handle various reading modes in Python.

### Writing to Files

Writing to files is another essential operation that enables programs to store data persistently. This repository includes examples of how to create a file, write data to it, and handle different writing modes in Python.

## Features

- Examples of reading from files in different modes (read, readline, readlines)
- Examples of writing to files in different modes (write, writelines, append)
- Error handling for file operations
- Detailed comments and explanations

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
